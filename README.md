# Repository-Pattern
The repository pattern is intended to create an abstraction layer between the data access layer and the business logic layer of an application. It is a data access pattern that prompts a more loosely coupled approach to data access. We create the data access logic in a separate class, or set of classes, called a repository with the responsibility of persisting the application's business model.
